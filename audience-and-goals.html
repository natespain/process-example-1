						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p>After researching different aspects around A Candle in the Window, I developed goals for each of the audiences I identified earlier.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>To define our Audience, we did an exercise where we brainstormed all the possible users of the website and then organized them into user groups. This would help us organize people groups and determine goals later on.</p>
					<!-- The class called "row" is called so that we can use the column classes (4u, 8u, etc) in the divs inside. -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ACW-20.jpg" alt="audience exercise" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>This is the product of my brainstorm. My user groups were Organizations, Nonmembers/possible members, and Members.
						<ol>
						<li>Organizations included those who would advertise and promote, Donors, and Skeptics. These could all possibly overlap but I must provide solutions for each need to be as extensive as possible.
						</li>
						<li>Nonmembers and possible members included tired missionaries, general travelers, and students. Missionaries often get burned out on the field from not taking sabbatical. ACW aims to help stop this by giving them low cost get-away options to enjoy fellowship and be refreshed. General travelers could be families, or Christian adults looking to travel and have fellowship. Students may be looking for cheap and safe travel where they can save money and have enriched experiences.
						</li>
					  <li>Members include big families with kids, missionary’s and pastor’s families specifically (due to their free membership), couples, members who host, and retired missionaries. All of these groups are global and diverse and have different backgrounds which plays into the goals and usability.
						</li>
					</ol>
						</p></div>

					<p>To ensure that we meet each user need, we developed overarching goals fir the client and audience as well as goals the website should meet.</p>
