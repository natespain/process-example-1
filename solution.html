						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p>After the research I formed a Call to Action to accomplish the goal of the website as well as a style tile to help convey the general feel.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image left"><img src="images/ACW_Call_To_Action.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>“Join Now” is the call to action speaking to the website’s non-member visitors. Since there are 2 main audiences, one of the two main goals is to attract new members to the network. An attention demanding button saying “join now” makes the navigation easy to accomplish the goal.
						</p></div>
						<p>The “Login” Call to action would be in the upper right because members would already know where it is because they have to do that every time they use the site. The “Login” call to action is for the members who want to connect with a host to find a place to stay or vice versa. This would allow easy access to streamline their booking process.
						</p>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u1"><p>I created a style tile to help convey the general feel of the website I will design.</p></div>
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ACW_Style_Tile.jpg" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>The adjectives I aimed at visually describing were warm, inviting, trustworthy, communal, friendly, casual, and authentic. These adjectives would help a user feel welcome and would encourage them to trust ACW and join the network.
						</p><p>
							To support the adjectives, I chose the serif display type Minion Variable Concept. This type appears traditional and sophisticated and would replicate the logo type I chose. For the body copy and some second headlines, I chose the sans serif Monserrat because it is easy to read in large amounts and is laid-back feeling. The letterforms appear spacious and friendly.
						</p><p>
							 I want to use imagery with similar textures that has high contrast and shows people enjoying fellowship and community in homes.
						</p>
						<p>The color scheme is also aimed at feeling welcoming and warm: mainly neutrals with small touches of color in small elements to emphasize the Mission or unite the page.
						</p>
						<p>The style tile also showcases the new logo I designed for ACW to match their new, modern branding. I wanted the logo to be a timeless lockup that felt authentic and friendly.
