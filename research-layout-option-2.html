						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p>I did primary research on my client, A Candle in the Window, and other secondary research on various Sharing economy news and organizations. I also interviewed my client and a target audience member.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Primary client research</h2>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="7u">
							<h3>Research from the GCCH website</h3>A unified social action agency fully committed to its ultimate goal: the eradication of homelessness with respect for the dignity and diversity of its membership, the homeless, and the community. This is accomplished by their coordinating of services, educating the public, and engaging in grassroots organizing and advocacy.
		The key point in my initial research was pin pointing the ways in which the GCCH planned to combat homelessness, by "coordinating services, educating the public, and engaging in grassroots organizing and advocacy."</p>

						<div class="5u$">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-10.png" alt="old GCHC website" /></span>
						</div>
						<div class="10u$">
							<h5>Coordinating Services</h5>
							<p>The coalition provides their membership agencies services, share their resources, and work with the homeless population.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="10u$">
							<h5>Advocacy</h5>
							<p>GCCH works with local officials, the community, and homeless people to ensure that the rights of homeless persons are preserved, that the trend of homelessness is reversed and that just social policy is enacted to end homelessness.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="10u$">
							<h5>Education</h5>
							<p>GCCH provides groundwork for understanding the complexities of homelessness so that [Cincinnati] can work towards sustainable solutions.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="10u$">
							<h5>Ways to Get Involved with GCCH</h5>
							<p>The site also featured information about how schools and churches can host "shantytowns", the coalition can provide speakers for a venue, and that they have a wish list of items that can be donated to help the cause.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="7u">
							<h5>Streetvibes</h5>
							<p>The Greater Cincinnati Homeless Coalition also has a newspaper called Streetvibes. The paper focuses on social justice issues and homelessness and features creative writing, poetry, articles, photography, and interviews written by homeless and formerly homeless individuals. The homeless can then sell the editions for two dollars to the public. They can then use this money as supplemental income. Some of their distributors can sell as many as 400 in a month.</p>

					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="12u"><h3>Recent News</h3></div>

						<div class="7u"><p>As the first part of my secondary research I decided to look at recent news in the Cincinnati area that might regard the homeless population.</p>
							<p>This article from the University of Cincinnati discusses the rising problem of Gentrification in Over-the-Rhine in downtown. This is a growing issue in Cincinnati as the city council and other corporations are kicking people out of their homes to build expensive condos and bring in wealthy class individuals. What is one to do if their rent keeps going up until they can no longer pay it or they are kicked out? The coalition advocates policy changes that prevent these sorts of incidents.</p></div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-17.png" alt="Gentrification article" /></span></div>

						<div class="7u"><p>Next, I researched ways to combat homelessness so that I could better understand the work that the coalition facilitates.</p>
							<p>One of the member organizations of the GCCH is Strategies to End Homelessness. Not only does this site show a successful example of a homelessness organization website but it also has great information on, well, strategies to end homelessness.</p></div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-18.png" alt="Strategies to End Homelessness website" /></span></div>

						<div class="7u"><p><strong>Shelter and Outreach</strong> is one step to combat homelessness. This helped me to understand that reaching out and offering shelter is the first steps to solving the problem. The homeless population cannot do it on their own so services must be made known to them so that they can seek help in the right places.</p>
							<p>This screen shot also talks about some of the improvements and successes of their shelters. So, this is the type of organization the coalition organizes with and advocates for.</p></div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-19.png" alt="Shelter and outreach page" /></span></div>

						<div class="7u"><p>Another way to combat homelessness, according to the same site, is housing options. There is transitional housing which included temporary housing with the goal to get individuals into permanent housing. There is also rapid re-housing which is also known as the housing-first approach. It is based on the data driven belief that people are more equipped to combat the reasons why they are homeless once they simply have a place to live. Finally, there is Permanent Supportive Housing which is meant for people with serious mental illness or other disabilities.</p>
							</div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-20.png" alt="Permanent housing page" /></span></div>

						<div class="10u$">
							<p>One reason I am looking closely at this website, although it does provide great information, is that it is well organized and features a clean design. The branding is also clear in other aspects of the site and the colors they use.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="7u"><p>Next, I further explored the social media of the GCCH. I found that their Facebook seemed to be much more current in its use. They even feature a "Mona and Mark Show" where members of the coalition discuss social issues surrounding homelessness in Cincinnati. This video, pictured above, is one in which they discuss displacement. This was a new concept for me as well; I did not consider that the removal of benches, places to sit and rest, was a strategy to keep the homeless away from the city. It appears that there are deeper consequences to city planning and that something as simple as removing a bench can make a huge difference. Mona and Mark discuss how displacement is not the solution and can actually harm the community further.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-21.png" alt="GCCH Youtube channel" /></span></div>

						<div class="7u"><p>Also they discuss current news in their Facebook. This is one instance where they are pointing out the injustices of homeless life and create a call to action for people to advocate a solution.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-22.png" alt="GCCH Facebook Article" /></span></div>

						<div class="12u$"><h4>Take Away</h4></div>

						<div class="10u$">
							<p>I would bring some of these current events and news to the website as well. The website should be a place to access the recent news for the coalition, and their social media.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="7u"><p>This is a web article form the coalition's Streetvibes paper. This piece discusses "Hostile Design" which is similar to displacement. It is city planners and builders purposefully changing the public space to be inhospitable to the homeless or even just people looking for a place to rest in the city.</p>
							<p>I think further incorporation of the Streetvibes paper into their main website is important to show some of the activism they are participating in.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-23.png" alt="Hostile design article" /></span></div>

						<div class="12u"><h3>The NYC Coalition for the Homeless</h3></div>

						<div class="7u"><p>Finally, I also looked at another homeless coalition to compare my site to. The New York City Coalition for the Homeless is a successful example of a coalition website. The color branding is clear and strong. There is a clear call-to-action. There even even secondary calls to action. And another thing I want to implement from this site is the use of statistics on the front page of the website. I think this creates even more appeal to the user to help and makes a homeless person ,who I suppose they think will use the site judging by the big "Get Help" button, feel less alone in their struggle.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="5u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-24.jpg" alt="The NYC Coalition for the Homeless website" /></span></div>

						<div class="7u"><p>The NYC Coalition also uses icons to show a visitor what they can do. They can take action (donate), volunteer, or maybe just do something as simple as learn what to do if you encounter homeless people in your life.</p>
							<p>These aspects of the NYC Coalition site are great ideas that I could implement into my own site.</p>

					<h2>Interviews</h2>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="12u">
							<p>For my interviews I managed to get in touch, via email, with the education director at GCCH. His name is Mark Mussman and he was nice enough to answer my questions fully and honestly. I also interviewed my significant other because he was the reason I chose this website. His perspective as a user struggling to navigate the site is valuable.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="12u"><h3>GCCH Interview</h3>
						<p><a href="images/GCHC-26.jpg">This screen shot</a> is the full interview with Dr. Mussman, the education director at GCCH. This interview was insightful because it helped me realize that they do not offer volunteer opportunities; they instead take interns or they can connect volunteers with one of their member organizations. That means my audiences and their goals will be slightly different. I also realized from this interview that they in fact do rely on donations from their site. Lastly, this interview shed some light on things they are looking for in a redesign that I had not considered such as a well organized mobile version of the site, a timeline of the coalition's history, and that their paper needs a place to share their past editions. Dr. Mussman was the education director so he could have been biased but he did make it out that education is a big goal of the coalition.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="12u"><h3>User Interview</h3>
						<p>I interviewed John Roth, a sociology major at University of Cincinnati and an Ohio resident.</p>
						<p>
							So, the user interview shed some light on the way some people might be approaching the GCCH website. John was looking for volunteering opportunities but did not find it because they do not offer any. So, the content in my design will explain in some way that the coalition can connect people with volunteer opportunities with their member organizations. Perhaps a tab that reads volunteering but once you get there it explains how they do not offer volunteering but they can connect you to their member organizations. I think that not having the tab, like John expressed in his interview, would cause confusion because many people first assume that a non-profit needs volunteers. Also if one of their primary audience members is students then these demographics will be looking for things like volunteering.
						</p>
						<p>
							I also overall know from John's confusion that the site needs a clearer design so that when a person visits they know what this organization does, why they are necessary, and what the user can do to contribute. It would be wasteful for users to come to the site with expectations and then leave it because a) they cannot find the answer to their purpose of visiting, or b) they don't know what the Coalition actually is.
