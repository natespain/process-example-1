						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p>Defining the Design Challenge was the first step. I used the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit as a guide to posing questions to find the root problems of the website for users.
</p>
					</header>
					<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
						<p>Getting people to join A Candle in the Window’s network hosting travelers and staying at host’s houses.</p>
						<h3>The Design Question:</h3>
						<p>How does A Candle in the Window website help users join the network to make faith-based connections and navigate hosting and requesting with ease?
</p>
						<h3>The Ultimate Impact</h3>
						<p>The goal is to grow the network of members and the frequency of which they use A Candle in the Window.</p>
						<h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
						<p>Simplifing the homepage and fonts, creating hierarchy, using photography, and clarifying the call to action as well as using negative space could all help solve the problems.</p>
						<h3>Context and Constraints</h3>
						<p>The website must be on a subscription based networking site, global users and their needs, and not up-to-date information.</p>
						<h3>The Design Question Restated</h3>
						<p><strong>"How can the re-design of this website attract new global members and simplify the hosting/booking process?"</strong></p>
						<hr>
						<p>This excercise got me thinking on person-based design terms. By identifying the roots of the problems and desired outcome, I was able to map out how to take steps towards the solution.</p>
